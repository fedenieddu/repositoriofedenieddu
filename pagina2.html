 Red Bull and Ferrari traded laps at the top in Saudi Arabia, but the two teams took different journeys towards their towering pace. Mark Hughes examines their respective approaches to set-up while Giorgio Piola provides technical illustrations.

        Last weekend in Jeddah there was a lot of experimentation with wing levels from almost all of the teams. The Saudi Arabian circuit features an extremely high proportion of the lap running at full throttle, and is second only to Monza in its lap time sensitivity to aerodynamic drag.

        But each design of car will vary in where exactly the perfect trade-off between downforce and drag is. Furthermore, because this was just the second race for the new aerodynamic regulations, teams were still finding out about how their cars responded to various settings in the real world as opposed to simulation.
        
        There is the further complication of the porpoising phenomenon. The bouncing suffered by some cars as the underfloor airflow stalls when the floor gets too close to the ground means that what was the ideal level of wing in simulation is no longer so in reality. Mercedes, for example, are one team which are surrendering a lot of the downforce that simulation suggested was available, just in order to keep the porpoising under control.</h4>
