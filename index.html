      <div class="col" id="descw13">"Ever since work on W13 began, I have seen an excited enthusiasm in our team members like never before, thanks to the scale of opportunity that these technical regulations provide," said Toto Wolff, Team Principal & CEO of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team. "Towards the end of the year when the car build project truly came together, I felt a deep passion across the whole organisation, not only in the technical arena but across our bases at Brackley and Brixworth who were embracing a mindset of 'we can do this'"</div>
      <div class="col" id="descw13">"We did pretty well during the last big regulatory change into the hybrid era and performed well when we went from the narrow to the wide cars in 2017. While we have a good track record, my message is clear: we can't rely on past success for this year's performance, but we can rely on our people, our culture, our structure, and our mindset to do the best possible job for 2022", continued Toto.</div>
      <div class="col" id="descw13">The W13 is the product of a complete redesign from top to bottom, with the steering wheel the only carryover element from its predecessor. Operating with a blank slate and such a steep development curve has been a stimulating experience for the engineers at the team's Brackley base and something they've relished.

      <div class="col" id="descw13">"This is an important day for us as we launch our car, the Ferrari F1-75. I must admit that personally, I'm excited about it, as this car is a product of the effort, dedication and passion of each one of us. It's down to the work of a group of people who have invested everything in this car, working with courage, creativity and team spirit," said Team Principal Mattia Binotto.</div>
      <div class="col" id="descw13">"We have a good team of people here who have gone from strength to strength, investing all their skills in this project and I am proud of them. We have tackled the challenged of this project with an innovative approach, because, apart from the requirements of the completely new technical regulations, we believe that we had to take on this exercise with an open mind."</div>
      <div class="col" id="descw13">The effectiveness of the venturi tunnel shape in lowering the air pressure of the underside (and therefore increasing the downforce) will determine how strongly the airflow is pulled into those venturi inlets. The sizing and shape of those inlets is therefore crucial. The cooling arrangement has to be configured around that aerodynamic requirement.</div>
